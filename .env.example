# Example env for apps/web. Do NOT commit real secrets. Use GitHub Secrets for CI.
# Local env variables you might need for local testing (example placeholders):

# NOTE: Cloudflare deployment configuration has been removed from this repo.
# If you later decide to re-enable Cloudflare Pages, contact the maintainer
# and they will help add secure deployment configuration and required secrets.

## Example .env file (cleaned)
## NOTE: For security we removed non-EmailJS example values from this file.
## Set production-only secrets like DATABASE_URL, AUTH_SECRET, and third-party
## keys in your hosting provider (Vercel/GitHub Actions) — do NOT commit secrets.

## Only EmailJS placeholders remain here (server-side email provider used by the app):
EMAILJS_USER_ID=your_emailjs_user_id_here
EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_emailjs_service_id_here
EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_emailjs_template_id_here

## If you need to re-enable examples for other envs, add them in the host UI,
## or request them explicitly; they were intentionally removed from repository.
